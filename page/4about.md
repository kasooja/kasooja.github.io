I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Propylon. 
Until September 2016, I was a Research Assistant at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at the National University of Ireland Galway. I am currently working with Paul Buitelaar in the Unit for Natural Language Processing.
Before joining Insight in March 2013, I did a Masters in Artificial Intelligence from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM), Madrid, Spain. During my Masters, I also worked as a research assistant at the Ontology Engineering group at UPM, Madrid.

My research interests lie at the confluence of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Distributional Semantics, Distributed Representations of Text, Text Classification, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Semantic Web.
