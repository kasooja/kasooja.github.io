1. [AWS Step Functions and Visual Workflows](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-build-distributed-applications-using-visual-workflows/)

2. AWS Lambda can initiate a state execution on StepFunctions, e.g. whenever an object is created on S3, a lambda is initiated which begins the state execution.
